# examples
These examples demonstrate how to run the wavelet scripts on a DEM, process the filter output, and plot the results.

#### Synthetic scarp
A simple vertical fault scarp with morphologic age 10^2.5. The DEM is whitened with low-amplitude Gaussian noise. The filter identifies the area around the main fault scarp as having high signal-to-noise ratio.

#### Synthetic scarp with cross channels
This synthetic scarp is cut by uniformly-spaced channels. The wavelet filter identifies both the scarp and "fluvial" channel walls as landforms produced by diffusion down steep slopes.

#### Carrizo Plain, USA
