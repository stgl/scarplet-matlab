**scarplet** is a set of tools for detecting scarp-like features in digital topographic data. This repository hosts a proof-of-concept Matlab implementation of the fault scarp template matching algorithm.

## Scarp overlays for the Pacific-North America plate boundary

A set of GIS layers covering the northern and southern San Andreas fault zones -- from Mendocino to the Salton Sea -- will be publicly available soon. Files will be available in GeoTIFF or ESRI grid format.

An actively developed, freely available Python application will be hosted at [scarplet-python](https://github.com/rmsare/scarplet-python). The distributed template matching framework builds on this codebase, and will be available in the [scarp-reduce repository](https://github.com/rmsare/scarp-reduce).

## Check it out now!

These data products are derived from the OpenTopography lidar data holdings, specifically the the [EarthScope Northern California](http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/datasetMetadata?otCollectionID=OT.052008.32610.1) and [Southern San Andreas datasets](http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/datasetMetadata?otCollectionID=OT.122009.32611.1) and the [B4 Project dataset](http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/datasetMetadata?otCollectionID=OT.032006.32611.1). Overlay maps are being produced as part of a National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program project, under award number G17AP00010.
