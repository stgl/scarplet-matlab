**scarplet** is a set of tools for detecting scarp-like features in digital topographic data. This repository hosts a proof-of-concept Matlab implementation of the fault scarp template matching algorithm. 

## Scarp-like landforms along the Pacific-North America plate boundary

A set of GIS layers covering the northern and southern San Andreas fault zones -- from Mendocino to the Salton Sea -- will be publicly available soon. These show the amplitude (height), morphologic age (smoothness), orientation, and signal-to-noise ratio for scarp-like features. Files will be available in GeoTIFF or ESRI grid format.

## Check it out now!

Click the images below to see scarp-like features detected along the North Coast segment of the **San Andreas Fault**, the **Rodgers Creek Fault**, and the **Green Valley Fault**. (Warning: large files.)
