**Scarplet** is a set of tools for detecting scarp-like features in digital topographic data. This repository hosts a proof-of-concept Matlab implementation of the fault scarp template matching algorithm. 

An actively developed, freely available Python application will be hosted at [scarplet-python](https://github.com/rmsare/scarplet-python). The distributed template matching framework builds on this codebase, and will be available in the [scarp-reduce repository](https://github.com/rmsare/scarp-reduce).

## Scarp overlays for the San Andreas fault system

A set of GIS layers covering the northern and southern San Andreas fault zone -- from Eureka to the Salton Sea -- will be publicly available soon.

These data products are derived from the OpenTopography lidar data holdings, specifically the the EarthScope Northern California and Southern San Andreas datasets and the B4 Project dataset. They were produced as part of a National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program project, under award number G17AP00010.
